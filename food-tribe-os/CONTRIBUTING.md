# Contributing Guide

## Ways to contribute
- Tackle an issue labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Improve docs (typos, clarity, examples)
- Propose enhancements via RFCs in `docs/rfcs/`
- Have a big idea for a new feature? Write it down as a 'Request for Comments' (RFC) in the /docs/rfcs folder. This is like a blueprint that we can discuss before any code is written.

## PR process
1. First, Fork the project (click the 'Fork' button on GitHub). This creates your own copy. Then, create a new branch in your copy with a descriptive name, like feat/user-profile-page or fix/login-button-bug.
2. We love tests! If you add a new feature, try to add a test for it. Make sure all tests pass by running pnpm -w test in your terminal.
3. Create a Pull Request from your forked repo to our main repo. Fill out the template so we know what you changed.
4. Your code will be checked by our automated robot (CI) and at least one human. We'll give you feedback and, once it's approved, merge your work!

## Commit style
Conventional Commits are a special way to write commit messages. It helps us automatically generate changelogs (notes for each new version). Always start your commit message with a type, like feat: (for a new feature) or fix: (for a bug fix).

## DCO
This is the legal part. It's basically you signing your name and saying, 'I wrote this code myself, and it's okay for the project to use it.' You don't need to do anything special for this other than agreeing to it by contributing.
