# Food Tribe OS - An Open-Source Food Services Platform

**Status:** In Development | R&D Project

## The Problem

Food service organizations, from local food banks to community gardens, often rely on disconnected, manual systems for critical operations. This leads to inefficiencies in inventory management, volunteer coordination, and event scheduling, which ultimately limits their impact. Food Tribe OS is an open-source initiative to solve this by providing a suite of modern, interconnected tools.

## Architectural Vision

This project is being architected as a distributed system using a **microservices approach**. The goal is to create independent, scalable services for core domains:

* **Identity Service:** Manages users, roles, and authentication.
* **Inventory Service:** Tracks food donations, supplies, and distribution.
* **Events Service:** Manages scheduling for volunteer shifts and community events.

This project also serves as my personal R&D lab for exploring and solving common challenges in distributed systems.

## The Role of Dapr

Building a resilient microservices architecture from scratch introduces significant complexity. This is precisely why Dapr was chosen as the foundational runtime for this project.

By leveraging Dapr's building blocks, I can focus on the core business logic for each service instead of the underlying infrastructure plumbing. Specifically, Dapr will be used for:

* **Service-to-Service Invocation:** To enable secure and reliable communication between the Identity, Inventory, and Events services.
* **State Management:** To handle the storage and retrieval of data for each service, abstracting away the underlying database.
* **Publish & Subscribe:** To create an event-driven system where, for example, a new donation in the Inventory Service can publish an event that the Events Service subscribes to, suggesting a new volunteer shift is needed.
