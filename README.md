Connecting good people to good food. The Operating System for a Circular Food Economy.

Food Tribe OS is an open-source platform designed to tackle systemic issues in our food system. We connect foodies, restaurants, non-profits, and governments to reduce food waste, combat hunger, and build a more sustainable future, starting at the local level. Our mission is rooted in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the principles of a circular economy.

üåÆ Core Products
The Food Tribe ecosystem is made up of several key products working together:

Food Tribe App: A mobile experience for "Foodies" to discover local dishes, save favorites, and leave detailed reviews using our unique TAPPP system.

TAPPP (Taste, Appearance, Price, People, Planet): Our proprietary 5-point review system that provides a holistic view of the dining experience, including social and environmental impact.

#RestaurantGrowth: A suite of tools and services for restaurants to manage their online reputation, reduce waste, and connect with their community.

RadicALL: Our data and research arm, a "think tank" dedicated to using food data to innovate and drive policy change.
